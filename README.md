#### About me
My name is Nicolas Micaux, final year student at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris.  
I'm looking for a 6-months internship abroad, ideally from april to september 2023, in AI research.  

#### My projects
_My github account has mainly **private** repositories containing my latest research and projects._  
_To see some of my projects, please head to my [personal website](https://sites.google.com/view/nicolas-micaux/home)._


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- a startup concept with NLP researchers at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris: Passive2Active converts "passive" lessons (PDFs, books, ...) to active learning content with the power of NLP
- testing of new architectures and training processes to improve neural networks: guiding the learning of neural networks (Human Guided Attention), accelerating the testing of architectures (FlexibleNAS)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m <del>currently</del> <ins>constantly</ins> learning about: everything that looks promising to me for the future of AI, even though I have kind of specialized in NLP recently.
